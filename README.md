# Anonymous Messenger
## Encrypted communication software with trustless technology (military security level)
We exacerbated the level of security by eliminating the backend: There is no backend that manages accounts, since there is no backend, ackers cannot enter a server that does not exist! Accounts are client-side only, just like for Bitcoin the account is a private key generated by a passphrase which is kept securely on the client side (the project derives from the Bitcoin project library and inherits its fundamental concepts).
Our mission is to exacerbate the concept of security in messaging and create something conceptually new and innovative from a technical point of view. Top-level encrypted communication (there is no backend , there is no server-side contact list, there is no server but a simple router, the theory is that if the server does not exist then the server cannot be hacked, the communication is anonymous, the IDs are derived from a hash of the public keys, therefore in no case it is possible to trace who originates the messages, the encryption key is changed for each single message, and a system of digital signatures guarantees the origin of the messages and prevents attacks "men in de middle"). We use different concepts introduced with Bitcoin technology and the library itself: there are no accounts, the account is simply a pair of public and private keys, groups are also supported, the group ID is derived from a hash computed through the public keys of the members, since the hash process is irreversible, the level of anonymity is maximum). The publication of the source wants to demonstrate the genuineness of the concepts we have adopted! Thanks for your attention!
[The software is based on an encrypted socket communication engine derived from bitcoin technology, of which you will find the technical specifications of the protocol here:](https://www.fuget.org/packages/SecureStorage/)

This project also includes a Bitcoin Wallet, Ethereum, token management on the ethereum network, NFT, integrated with the messaging app, to activate these projects at startup you need to use the DEBUG_RAM startup mode.

This project has three open source dependencies for security and functionality. These dependencies are implemented here in the form of Nuget packages, and here are the sources on GitHub (you can replace the nuget packages with the source projects if you want):

[Secure storage](https://github.com/Andrea-Bruno/SecureStorage) it is a powerful data safe, the cryptographic keys and data that would allow the software to be attacked are kept with this tool.
[Encrypted messaging](https://github.com/Andrea-Bruno/EncryptedMessaging) it is a powerful low-level cryptographic protocol, of the Trustless type, which manages communication, groups and contacts (this software will never access your address book, this library is the heart of the application)
[Communication channel](https://github.com/Andrea-Bruno/EncryptedMessaging/tree/master/CommunicationChannel) is the low-level socket communication protocol underlying encrypted communication.

Friendly projects for which we underline the importance of maintaining computer privacy:

* [DuckDuckGo (DDG)](https://duckduckgo.com/) is an internet search engine that emphasizes protecting searchers' privacy and avoiding the filter bubble of personalized search results.

* [The tor project](https://www.torproject.org/): is a Seattle-based 501 nonprofit organization founded by computer scientists Roger Dingledine, Nick Mathewson, and five others. The Tor Project is primarily responsible for maintaining software for the Tor anonymity network. 

* [Kali linux](https://www.kali.org/): is a Debian-derived Linux distribution designed for digital forensics and penetration testing. It is maintained and funded by Offensive Security.

* [LineageOS](https://lineageos.org/): is an Android-based operating system for smartphones, tablet computers, and set-top boxes, with mostly free and open-source software.
